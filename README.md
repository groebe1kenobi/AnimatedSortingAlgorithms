# AnimatedSortingAlgorithms

This was a project for my iOS Development II course at DePaul. 
The goal was to learn animation concepts, multi-threading, and refresh on sorting algorithms.
There are two seperate views embeded in one view, where the user selects the size of the array,
and then each view has a UISegmentedControl bar which determines which algorithm to use.
When the "Sort" button is pressed, the randomly generated array representations are sorted.
